Watching: **Writing Beautiful Packages in Go**

Author(s): Mat Ryer

Finished: 12:25

### Before Writing a Package
Packages have some internal and external fields, structs, functions, etc. Package main is _only_ for commands. 

> Think of packages like creating an API

Useful questions to ask before writing a package spec
```
Who is the user?
What are they trying to do?
Why are they doing it?
Why are they using my package?
Is my package part of a bigger system?
```

### Exports
Make sure the number of exported "items" is as small as possible. 

### Types
Core package functions should have broader types as arguments. e.g. `io.Writer` instead of `os.File`. 

### Single Method Interfaces
Try to implement _single_ method interfaces, where there's just a single function to call. Here's a good and famous example.
```
single-method interface
type Handler interface {
	ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
}

// function adapter
type HandlerFunc func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)

func (h handlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	return h(w, r)
}
```

### Package Subfolders
`cmd` - commands only
`pkg` - packages only
`testdata` - data for tests
`docs` - extra docs?

### Rakyll Style Guide
Use multiple .go files
Keep types close to where they're used
Organize by responsibility (user type goes into user.go)
Optimize for the godoc and provide examples
